# BookCompanion

When I was a kid, I never liked to read books during class. My parents, tutors, peers and even older relatives always recommended that I read on my own time. I always shunned reading, until after grade 12 when I learned of its importance.

BookCompanion is a web-app that I made to help motivate me to read books and log them. I decided that I should challenge myself and create a web-app instead of jotting down reading logs the traditional way.

### Features

- Compelling booklist UI which contains a table that organizes book logs by name, author and ISBN. Can also cycle between pages of entries via the table.
- Includes functionality and alerts for adding, editing and deleting book records.
- Reading logs are pushed to a local SQL Database managed in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). Data can also be managed from SSMS.

### Skills

- Programming languages: HTML, JavaScript, CSS
- Libraries/Frameworks: React.js, Express.js, Node.js
- Database: MongoDB
