# BookCompanion

When I was a kid, I always never liked to read books during class. My parents, tutors, peers and even older relatives always recommended that I read on my own time. Regardless of this, I always shunned reading, until after grade 12 when I learned of the importance of it especially in software development.

BookCompanion is a web-app that I made to help motivate me to read books and log them. I decided that I should challenge myself and create a web-app instead of jotting down reading logs the traditional way.
